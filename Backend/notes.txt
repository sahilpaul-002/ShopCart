Key Points to Remember when cookie is used
Use httpOnly: true so JavaScript can't access the cookie (better security).

Set secure: true when using HTTPS in production.  remenber to do this

Use sameSite to prevent CSRF attacks (strict or lax recommended).

On the frontend, always enable withCredentials: true.

Understand JWT Token in detail and check if our logic is correct (need to check if we need to equal the user input and jwt input)
